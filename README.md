- 👋 Hi, I’m @acrestudio-jesse
- 👀 I’m interested in art, interactive frontend design, community based apps.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning mostly frontend frameworks, recently svelte, flutter and nextjs.
  I'm also trying to work on several community driven productivity apps, akin to 
trello mixed with instagram, without all the skeezy spyware aspects.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on front end apps geared towards deliberate engagement.
I see a problem in the world with how people are passively consuming media and contributing/
building very little. My goal is to streamline the process of creation, as well as, expose 
new creators more easily to audiences. Not to monetize, but get them the confidence to engage in their
passions.
- 📫 How to reach me: acreillustration.github@gmail.com is a pretty good bet.
